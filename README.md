This project was built as a SPA (Single-Page Application) to serve as boilerplate template for my new projects.

Bootstrapped with the following packages:
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app): For easy react development setup.
- React-Router: To manage navigation trought the entire application.
- Styled Components: New way to apply styles to components.
- React-Bootstrap: CSS Framework to make the app responive.
- React-Helmet: To manage header meta tags on react apps to work with SEO.
- Enzyme: To build easier tests for components.
- Google Analytics: to track the performance of the app (This script should be replaced when creating a new app).
